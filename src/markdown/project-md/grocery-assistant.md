Grocery Assitant is an Android application that I and my team built during Software Engineering course.
The features include locating and showing information about nearby grocery store, personal grocery list,
and recipe suggestion.
In this project, I integrated
<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/overview" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>
and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview" target="_blank">Places API </a>
to locate and show information about grocery stores nearby the user and also, independently created the landing page to showcase the application.
