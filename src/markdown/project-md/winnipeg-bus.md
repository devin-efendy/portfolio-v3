A Chrome Extension that displays nearby bus stops and schedules across Winnipeg. 
Users also able to search for specific stops.
The transit data is acquired using <a href="https://api.winnipegtransit.com/home/api/v3" target="_blank" >Winnipeg Transit's Open Data Web Service API</a>.
This was the first time I tried making API calls in my project. I learned a lot about async JavaScript.
