This is my third iteration of my online portfolio. Built with GatsbyJS and GraphQL.
In my opinion, this iteration is a significant improvement from the previous two.
I also tried to dockerize the local development environment and use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/" target="_blank" >AWS Amplify</a> 
for deployment to integrate Continuous Deployment to the workflow of this project.
