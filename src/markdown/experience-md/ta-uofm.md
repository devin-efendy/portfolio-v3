Teaching is really rewarding! I was a TA for Programming Practices course. I conducted lab sessions and assisted students to understand lab materials: C, UNIX, and programming best practices. I also graded assignments for two courses: Introductory to Computer Science 2 and Operating Systems. To cut down marking time, I created a shell and python scripts to automate the major and repetitive steps in the marking process.
