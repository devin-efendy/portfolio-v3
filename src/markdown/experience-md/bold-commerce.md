At Bold, I was working in Checkout Plugin & API team. The team develops plugin features and API endpoints for <a href="https://boldcommerce.com/checkout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Bold Checkout </a>. One of my main resposibility is to maintain one of Bold's internal plugin which gives customer a discount when they share their purchases to Facebook or Twitter. The technologies that I used are React, PHP/Laravel, JavaScript, MySQL, and Docker.
