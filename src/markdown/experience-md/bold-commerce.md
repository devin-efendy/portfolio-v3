During my co-op term at Bold, I was working in Checkout Plugin & API team.
The team develops <a href="https://docs.cashier.boldapps.net/integration/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">plugin features and API endpoints</a> for <a href="https://boldcommerce.com/checkout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Bold Checkout </a>.
One of my main resposibility is to maintain one of Bold's internal plugin which gives customer a discount when they share their purchases to Facebook or Twitter.
The technologies that I used are React, PHP/Laravel, JavaScript, MySQL, and Docker.
