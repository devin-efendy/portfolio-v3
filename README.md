# Portfolio V3

This is my third iteration of my online portfolio. The design of this portfolio is inspired by [framer.com](framer.com). I think there is a significant improvement compared to the prveious iteration. For example, animation, typography, and responsiveness.

## **Tech Stack**

This is made using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) which is a React framework that offer good performance. Also, I used [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) for querying local data from markdowns. For styling I used [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) and for animation library I used [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) (which is super awesome!).

I also dockerized the local development environment so that I can easily develop this project in other machine that have Docker installed.

For the deployment, I use [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) because I want to learn and integrate Continuous Deployment for this project.
